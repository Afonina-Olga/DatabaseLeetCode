# 511. Game Play Analysis I

**Table:** ```Activity```

```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |

+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

# **Task:

Write a solution to find the first login date for each player.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

# **Example:**

**Input:**

```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-05-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
```

**Output:**

```
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | first_login |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | 2016-03-01  |
| 2         | 2017-06-25  |
| 3         | 2016-03-02  |
+-----------+-------------+
```

# **Solution 1:**

``` SQL
WITH cte AS
  (SELECT player_id,
          event_date,
          RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY player_id
                      ORDER BY event_date) AS rank
   FROM Activity)
SELECT player_id,
       event_date AS first_login
FROM cte
WHERE rank = 1;
```

# **Solution 2:**

``` SQL
SELECT player_id,
       MIN(event_date) AS first_login
FROM Activity
GROUP BY player_id
```
